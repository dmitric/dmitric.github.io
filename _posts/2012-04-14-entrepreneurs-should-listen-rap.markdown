I've always enjoyed <a href="http://bhorowitz.com/" target="_blank">ben's blog</a> for it's straight forward, and insightful articles.

For any young entrepreneur/hacker, it's an extremely useful place to learn about non trivial topics like <a href="http://bhorowitz.com/2011/01/04/when-smart-people-are-bad-employees/">building</a> <a href="http://bhorowitz.com/2012/01/19/the-freaky-friday-management-technique/">a</a> <a href="http://bhorowitz.com/2010/08/23/how-to-minimize-politics-in-your-company/">winning</a> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664">team</a>, <a href="http://bhorowitz.com/2010/03/14/notes-on-leadership-be-like-steve-jobs-and-bill-campbell-and-andy-grove/">being</a> <a href="http://bhorowitz.com/2011/08/08/the-fine-line-between-fear-and-courage/">a</a> <a href="http://bhorowitz.com/2010/05/30/how-andreessen-horowitz-evaluates-ceos/">leader</a>, as well as insight into the <a href="http://bhorowitz.com/2010/04/13/four-things-some-vcs-do-that-i-dont-like/">VC</a> <a href="http://bhorowitz.com/2012/01/31/why-has-andreessen-horowitz-raised-2-7b-in-3-years/">world</a> and entrepreneursip in general. It's a veritable gold mine of information, and yet, it's hard to put a lot of it to use at this stage of my life.

At this point in the game, 23 years of age for me, the most useful thing I've learned from reading his blog is that I should listen to hip hop as much as possible.

If you haven't realized by now, all of his blog articles are prefaced by a rap quote. At first I didn't pay much attention to it, but then I read that all of his articles are inspired by rap lyrics. Not the other way around.

So I decided to start listening to rap a little more. It took a bit of time, but I quickly realized how powerful rap music really is, because when it comes down to it, it's <em>all about hustle</em>. Those articles were inspired by hustle, not for the sake of recounting them. And at this stage in my life, hustle is what I need.

Believe or not, rap lyrics have helped me express a lot of what I've had to deal so far when starting my own company:

Realizing that <a href="http://paulgraham.com/hiring.html">being young, and productive doesn't do you good as an employee</a>:

> I don't want the glow, I want the glo-ray

> And I'mma fuck the world, but this is just foreplay

> Tired of hearing bullshit, bring on the cow shit

> Haven't met a smell that's stinkier then our shit

So far I've found it to be extremely inspirational, and in my opinion serves as a pretty good soundtrack to the life of an entrepreneur. You can say whatever you want about rap as an art form, but it fosters a mentality of hustling, winning and being hungry -- the very same things you need to be an entrepreneur.

I know I'm still at the beginning of my journey, but you can rest assured that rap has the lyrics I'll need after our team succeeds. They better quit printin' dictionaries, because we about to redefine hustle.

PS. I understand there are lots of aspects of rap music that aren't that great, even despicable, but I'm trying to focus on the good parts.
