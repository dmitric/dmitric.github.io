  As a technical founder who originally hated the idea of starting a company with someone who couldn't code, I have changed my mind. Working with non-technical founders has made.

When I first decided to start an internet technology company -- or "startup" as some like to call it -- there was only one thing I was sure of:

## I would start it with someone else who could program.

As a young, inexperienced, yet competent \[enough\] engineer, the thought of working with a non-technical cofounder irked me.

I believe a lot of that had to do with how many young programmers, including myself, used to perceive people who couldn't code -- they just didn't care enough to learn.

I would often ask myself questions like:

- If they wanted to work in technology, why wouldn't they spend the time learning to code?
- If they can't work on the product directly, what value do they add at such an early stage?
- How can I depend on them if they don't understand what's going on under the hood?
- How do I know if they can deliver on their promises or evaluate the quality of their work?

The reality is, those are all valid questions -- and hard ones to answer at that.

## Non-technical founders without a track record have really big shoes to fill before a technical founder would even consider them over another technical founder.

On top of that, hardly a day went by where I didn't read a re-hash of the ever popular blog post "how to find a technical cofounder" and disagree with nearly every point. Or had the opportunity to meet with a self-proclaimed tech visionary who just needed a little coding help to turn his fledgling idea into reality -- despite having little experience with technology mind you.

## Many non-technical founders who put themselves out there give other non-technical founders a bad name.
